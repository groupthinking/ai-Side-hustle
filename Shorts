### **How to Make Money with Short Projects**

#### **1. Introduction**
I’ve been quietly exploring short drama projects. After several platform adjustments, the industry has finally reached a relatively stable phase. Today, I’ll walk you through how short drama projects operate and the main ways to make money from them. I hope this information will be helpful to you.  
In the online money-making world, it’s become clear that truly “new” money-making projects are rare. Most new ventures are simply old methods with a new twist, often requiring higher entry thresholds.  
You may have heard people say, *“Our skills are improving, but our profits are shrinking. It feels like walking up an escalator that’s moving downward — no matter how hard you try, you stay in the same spot.”*  
Given this environment, there are three possible strategies:  
1. **Enter a new, emerging field** — like AI-related industries.  
2. **Go international** — explore growing markets in Southeast Asia or similar regions.  
3. **"Downgrade to dominate"** — pick simpler projects but use more advanced strategies to boost profits.  
I opted for the third approach and have seen some promising results. Today, I’m sharing insights on short drama projects, their methods, and how to profit from them.

#### **2. What is a Short Drama?**  
In simple terms, a short drama is a combination of a **high-end novel-to-video adaptation** and a **low-end video highlights compilation**.  
Here’s how it works:  
- Adapt a popular "feel-good" web novel into short, engaging videos with **fast-paced, high-conflict storylines** to grab viewers’ attention.  
- The video often cuts off at a cliffhanger, prompting users to click a link to unlock the full episode.  
- When users pay to watch the full series, creators earn a **commission of 54% to 70%** on the user’s payment.  
#### **3. Main Ways to Monetize Short Drama Projects**  
The ecosystem for short drama projects is structured as follows:  
> **Drama Creators** → **Short Drama Platforms** → **Distribution Platforms** → **Team Leaders** → **Content Creators** → **End Users**  
The industry is no longer the “wild west” it once was. While the chance for "quick riches" has faded, the system is more lightweight and refined. Here are the three main ways to make money:  
**1. Self-Run Model**  
- **Workflow**: Master the **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)** → Build multiple accounts → Post large volumes of content daily → Aim for positive return on investment (ROI) → Seek collaborations for extra income.  
- **Key Points**:  
  - Hire video editors, each managing 5-8 accounts, posting 2-3 video mashups daily, focusing on male-oriented or female-oriented niches.  
  - **Win with volume** — Success comes from producing large quantities of videos, increasing the odds of a viral hit. One successful video could generate thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars.  
  - **Challenges**:  
    1. It’s hard to get started without an experienced mentor.  
    2. Real-name verification is required for accounts, and one person can only verify one account, making this a bottleneck.  
    3. **Cost control** — It’s difficult to recruit employees, so it’s better to hire in lower-cost cities. The goal is to achieve a **per-person productivity of $2,000/month**.  
**2. Agency Model**  
- **Workflow**: Recruit seed fans → Leverage viral growth and referrals → Classify followers by potential → Continuous community engagement → Win with volume → Generate "passive" income → Private domain growth → Diversified monetization.  
  - Recruit seed users via promotions or buying followers, then teach them to edit and distribute short drama content, encouraging viral growth.  
  - Use affiliate platforms (like **GoodDiscount Short Drama**) to manage agents and editors while offering incentives to boost sales.  
  - **Traffic Acquisition**: Combine self-driven traffic and outsourced viral growth. Recruit part-time editors to process video content, and use their accounts to distribute the videos. This is a good model for small teams, as it’s fast to start and has a low barrier to entry.  
**3. CPS (Cost-Per-Sale) Model**  
- **Workflow**: Run ads on public platforms → Convert traffic to private platforms (like WeChat or Telegram) → Promote short dramas → Users pay to watch → Earn CPS commission.  
  - Run ads (like TikTok ads) to bring users into a private group (WeChat, Discord, etc.) where they are pitched on watching short dramas.  
  - New platforms like **RedFruit Drama** and **"Free Drama Bots"** offer free streaming options, which has increased competition, extending the time it takes to recoup ad spending.  
  - **Tip**: Focus on “secondary monetization” — beyond selling drama access, add extra income streams like affiliate products, online courses, or paid memberships.  
#### **4. Materials You'll Need**  
- **Basic Equipment**: Smartphone, computer, TikTok accounts (1-5 accounts), accounts on drama distribution platforms, and editing tutorials.  
- **Editing Options**: Styles include **repost edits**, **mashups**, **"hype" edits**, and **narrated recaps**. Each style varies in production effort and profitability.  
- **Networking Channels**: Short drama rules change fast, so joining industry groups (like Discord or Telegram) is essential for updates.  
#### **5. Expected Earnings**  
- **Self-Run Model**: Target productivity of **$2,000 per person**; with a 10-person team, monthly net profits can reach **$11,000 to $12,000**.  
- **Agency Model**: With a community of 500 followers, you can expect passive income of **$7,000 to $14,000 per month**.  
- **CPS Model**: Industry benchmarks suggest it takes about **6 months to recoup costs**. Building strong traffic sources is essential, and it’s often best to combine this model with other businesses.  
#### **6. Who Should Join?**  
1. **Content creators** with basic editing skills and 2-4 hours of daily free time — ideal for the **Self-Run Model**.  
2. **Private domain marketers** with part-time job audiences or fan groups — ideal for the **CPS + CPA Model**.  
3. **Ambitious beginners** who can accept slow growth at first but aim for stable, steady returns later — ideal for the **Self-Run Model**.  
4. **Team leaders** with management experience — start with a successful test project, then scale up with a team.  
#### **7. Industry Trends and Future Prospects**  
The short drama industry has been trending for the past **2 years**. During this time, it’s gone through three distinct phases:  
1. **Industry boom** — Explosive demand and easy profits.  
2. **Gameplay boom** — Many new strategies to profit.  
3. **Platform boom** — Platforms rapidly evolved, adjusting payout models and regulations.  
Now, the industry is more **stable**. The “quick cash” era is gone, but profits are more consistent. Platforms are also giving better support to **original content**, so creators who prioritize originality have an advantage.  
As low-quality content gets purged from the market, opportunities arise for **"good players"** to establish a lasting edge. While it’s no longer a "get-rich-quick" industry, the stability and scalability are better than ever.  
#### **8. Final Thoughts**  
The short drama industry is not a **"get-rich-quick" scheme**, but for those seeking sustainable, stable income, it’s a great option.  
However, entry barriers exist. Without a mentor or precise execution, it’s difficult to achieve large profits. The success factors boil down to three core concepts:  
- **Stability** — Consistent, reliable cash flow.  
- **Refinement** — Optimizing content, strategy, and team execution.  
- **Accumulation** — The longer you stay, the bigger your advantage.  
If you’re looking for **stable and steady income growth**, the short drama industry may be worth exploring.
